					desc="Waxing is a method of semi-permanent hair removal which removes the hair from the root. Wax is applied to the skin in the direction of hair growth, then quickly removed against the direction of hair growth, taking the hair with it. This method can be used to remove hair from various parts of the body, including the legs, underarms, bikini area, and face. Waxing can provide longer-lasting results than shaving, as it removes hair at the root rather than just cutting it at the surface. It's a safe and effective way to remove unwanted hair and leave your skin smooth and hair-free."
